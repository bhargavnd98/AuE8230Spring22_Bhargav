Introduction
Hello, this is Bhargav, a graduate student at CUICAR, specializing in Autonomous Vehicles, Perception and Robotics. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Electronics Engineering and I am particularly interested in making computers "see". 

This repository will contain everything related to the turtlebot, Gazebo, TurtleSim and instructions on how to run specific files, source codes and run simulations.

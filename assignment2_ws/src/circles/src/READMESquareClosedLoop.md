Unlike the square_openloop code, this code does not take any inputs from the user apart from the coordinates of the destination. A 'P' controller is implemented to control the speed and the angular velocity of the turtle. This is a closed loop system as it 'learns' from its own system and takes up a certain linear and angular velocity which suits best for its trjectory.

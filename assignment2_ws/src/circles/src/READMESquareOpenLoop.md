This code takes several inputs from the user such as, the initial velocity of the turtle, the angular velocity, the direction in which the turtle should move, angle of rotation and the distance which the turtle needs to travel before making a turn. 
The distance is taken as an input to make the turtle trace a square of 2*2 units. Linear and Angular velocities are taken from the user as an input so a variety of velocities can be tested upon.
